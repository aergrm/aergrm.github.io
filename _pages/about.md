I employ computational and experimental methods to investigate how **polarization** and **emerging technologies** are influencing **international security** and **foreign policy**.

My research examines strategic decision-making in 21st-century international security. I focus on two key drivers:

1.  **Domestic Politics:** I analyze how public opinion and audience costs shape foreign policy. My dissertation focuses on this intersection using survey experiments supported by the *Institute of Humane Studies at George Mason University*.
2.  **Emerging Technologies:** I explore the geopolitical impact of technologies such as AI and semiconductors.

Methodologically, I employ a computational toolkit, especially text analysis and network analysis, alongside quantitative and experimental methods. I am an alumnus of the [ICPSR Summer Program in Quantitative Methods](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/) (University of Michigan) and the [SICSS - Istanbul](https://sicss.io/2023/istanbul/people).

My work has been published or is forthcoming in *International Political Science Review*, *International Relations*, and edited volumes from *Routledge* and *Wiley*. I have also contributed policy analysis on regional energy security and conflict dynamics for think tanks.

I hold M.A. and B.A. degrees in International Relations from **Bilkent University** in Turkey.
