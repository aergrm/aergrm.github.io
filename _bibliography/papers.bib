abstract  = {Leadership attributes such as hawk are commonly used in academia and media. However, very few studies empirically examine the concept of ‘hawk’ and show nuances about this leadership attribute in international relations (IR), which inform our theories. This study aims to advance conceptual clarity in IR and address this problem by bringing cases from Middle East and North Africa leaders. By utilizing operational code analysis, I empirically test whether pundits’ assumptions about leaders’ hawkishness are reflected in their political and strategic beliefs. I analyze eight leaders from Syria, Iran, Iraq, and Israel. I statistically compare their results with a norming group of world leaders and within themselves. I use novel data comprising 1307 statements with nearly 2 million words. The results show that leadership attributes such as ‘hawk’ are more nuanced than assumed. The findings challenge the assumption that hawkish leaders are homogenous in their political beliefs.},

abstract  = {Computational methods have been increasingly used in Foreign Policy Analysis (FPA). Text analysis, geospatial analysis, and network analysis are among the most used computational methods. This article examines the FPA literature that utilizes computational methods and discusses their theoretical and empirical implications for future research. I argue that while these methods are not without their criticisms, the integration of computational tools enables FPA researchers to create and use big data sets, improve sampling, and collect and analyze data. Computational methods in FPA enable theory-driven analysis of big data, providing both theoretical and empirical insights, and allowing testing of micro-level foundations of FPA theories. However, challenges such as the validity of measures and selection bias should be taken into account. While computational methods present significant opportunities for advancing FPA, these challenges need consideration.},

abstract  = {Turkey is an emerging middle power with its size of the economy, growing military capabilities, and active participation in multilateral organizations. Turkey has possessed relevant economic growth over the years and taken part in international organizations such as G20 that gather established and emerging middle powers. Turkey has engaged in proactive diplomacy and coalition-building, indicating its willingness to pursue an assertive foreign policy. As an emerging middle power, Turkey’s alignments can have implications for the evolving multipolar world order. The rise of China and Russia challenges the US-led international order established in the post-Cold War period. The position of the middle powers in this emerging multipolar world order has become an interesting and important case. This chapter will analyze Turkey’s international relations and its ties with superpowers, the US and China, and the neighboring great power, Russia, by focusing on economic and military/security dimensions.},

abstract  = {The semiconductor industry is at the heart of core case studies related to the understanding of broader dynamics of technological developments and international competition in the 21st century. Much has been written about the superpower rivalry between the United States (US)and China, but this chapter highlights significant and growing contributions from middle powers in research, development, and production of semiconductors. This chapter compares the changing role of middle powers in the global semiconductor industry, drawing examples from Japan, South Korea, Türkiye, and Malaysia. The book chapter makes a comparative analysis of research output, patent data, policy initiatives, and industry development in the countries under study and their respective positions. Also, the chapter makes a deeper analysis of Türkiye’s semiconductor research and development efforts. The results suggest diversified strategies and capacities of the established middle powers, Japan and South Korea, compared to the emerging middle powers, Türkiye and Malaysia. In this research, network analysis is used to map patterns of international collaboration and to identify nodes of influence within global semiconductor research and innovation networks. Our results reveal significant differences between well-established middle powers, such as Japan and SouthKorea, and emerging ones like Türkiye and Malaysia. Japan and South Korea have strong research output and are leaders in patent applications in semiconductor production. While their research impact is relatively much lower, Türkiye and Malaysia are building emerging strengths. Much of the work in Türkiye aims toward defense and strategic applications. In Malaysia, an existing position in semiconductor assembly provides the opportunity for moving up the value chain. In terms of publications, the output of both countries increased linearly since the beginning of the 2000s. In terms of patent applications, Japanese and South Korean companies dominate the patent application network, particularly in semiconductor production and intermediate products. The study helps to further our understanding of how middle powers can pursue various roadmaps in an era of technological innovation and economic competitiveness in the semiconductor industry.},

abstract  = {This study is centered on the thematic analysis of cryptocurrency, a methodical exploration of various themes, patterns, and debates inherent to the cryptocurrency domain. Employing rigorous methodologies, including data mining and data analysis, this study systematically extracts and categorizes themes from an extensive corpus of cryptocurrency-related literature, encompassing academic papers, articles, and discussions. The aim is to discern nuanced insights into diverse dimensions of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, spanning technological discussions (notably blockchain and smart contracts), market trends, legal considerations, security vulnerabilities, adoption challenges, and the consequential impacts on various industries. The research under consideration illuminates the escalating ubiquity of the term cryptocurrency and scrutinizes the publication patterns of esteemed authors within the field of bibliometric research. Our study incorporates an extensive number of academic studies on cryptocurrency, employing a diverse range of methodologies that leverage distinct features of the datasets to unravel multifaceted interpretations of the subject matter. Through these methodological approaches, we have successfully identified prevailing themes, including theoretical controversies, regional publication patterns, and variations in the utilization of databases and analytical tools. Particularly noteworthy is the discernible upswing in the volume of scholarly works and applications dedicated to the realm of cryptocurrencies. These applications and scholarly outputs serve as indispensable instruments for scientific cartography, informing decision-making processes in fields such as finance, management, and sustainability. It is pertinent to highlight the emergent recognition of the concept of “cryptocurrency thematic analysis,” with thematic analysis itself assuming a pivotal role as a valuable tool for researchers, entrepreneurs, and governmental entities. This analytical framework facilitates a nuanced comprehension of the dynamic characteristics of cryptocurrencies, an enhanced understanding of public sentiment, and the pinpointing of specific areas necessitating further research or intervention.},

abstract  = {Using an original dataset that codes the hawkishness of over 50 national leaders across 30 years, this study employs panel data regression analysis to test the relationship between a leader's psychological disposition and national military expenditure. The results indicate that highly hawkish leaders, independent of controlling for real security threats, alliance commitments, and regime type, correlate with a statistically significant increase in defense spending as a proportion of GDP. This research supports the primary importance of individual-level variables in models of defense policy formation.},
